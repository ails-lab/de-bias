The organization was headed by longtime unionist Tom Mann and future General Secretary of the CPGB Harry Pollitt. The National Minority Movement (NMM) was established at a convention held August 23–24, 1924, attended by 271 delegates, claiming to represent 200,000 workers. By the time of the NMM's formation in 1924, the Comintern had abandoned strategies based on the prospect of an imminent world revolution in favour of slow, gradual working within established institutions, including ""pure and simple"" reformist trade unions. The aim of the National Minority Movement was to convert the revolutionary minority of the working class into a majority. The NMM would organise workers who were dissatisfied with the existing unions but not willing to join the Communist Party, as well as those who were already CP members. In this way the Communists would increase their influence in amongst workers without splitting the existing organisations.","reject"

Aberg Group 1 (c. 450-c. 500). Parts of the pin-lug, the foot and the catch-plate are missing due to old breaks. The head-plate is sub-square in plan (10.0 x 14.6mm). It is slightly convex at the front and slightly concave at the rear. A circular top-knob is divided from the head-plate by a lateral collar. Both the top knob and the collar are flat at the rear. Originally, it had side knobs but these were attached onto the ends of an iron wire chord that was passed through the centre of the coiled spring to hold it in place. The bow (27.1 x 9.0 x 5.6mm) is convex at the front and deeply concave at the rear. At the top, the width of the bow is 8.1mm and expands in width towards the centre slightly and then narrows towards the foot where its width is 5.9mm. At each corner of the bow there is a small facet. Only a small portion of the foot and catch-plate survives and the catch-plate is off-set to one side and is almost flush with one of sides of the foot. A single pin lug at the rear of the head plate is centrally situated. The undecorated brooch has a mid-brown pitted patina overall and the pitting is particularly noticeable at the front of the bow. There is no evidence for melting or burning. 57.6 x 14.6mm. Weight: 9.62g. MacGregor and Bolick have commented on cruciform brooches: ‘…only a minority of cruciform brooches have been found in pairs: they were, it seems, commonly worn singly on the breast, sometimes in association with a pair of brooches of different design at the shoulders. Whether their occurrence in this position is to be interpreted as purely decorative, or whether they may have secured an over garment such as a cloak, remains unresolved. Where the context is known, they are almost invariably found in female graves. Three principal divisions may be recognised in the brooch: the head-plate, the arched bow, and the foot. The cruciform outline is completed by a pair of lateral wings which emerge from the head-plate, the form being accentuated by the presence of three knobs, one at the top of the head-plate and one at the extremity of either wing; these in turn may each have decorative extensions projecting from them. On some early brooches these lateral extensions of the head-plate are functional in that they carry the pin axis, but on most examples they are purely decorative. Variations occur on all these elements, some of which evidently have chronological implications, while in other instances indications of a linear progression seem to defy detection. The relative importance ascribed to the head plate and wings is striking in variety. In the earliest forms, which remain rare in England, the wings may be absent altogether…’ (MacGregor and Bolick 1993, 95).","reject"

You have no idea what<br /> rottenly made stuff they use out here it is<br /> mostly lead I think, & the knives never cut.<br /> Half the village has been in to inspect I am<br /> told, but luckily I’ve been out!<br /> <br /> <br /> The cake is quite the best Mary has sent out,<br /> & has lasted two tea parties, (fights, or actions,<br /> comme vous voulez!) already, and looks good for another<br /> attack! The knee pads are a great boon, &<br /> have arrived in time to prevent my legs chafing<br /> the corners of the tank quite away. The jets & {unreadable}<br /> have been put to excellent use already, & should<br /> prove invaluable. Thanks so much also for the<br /> gaspers & chocolate biscuits. I had quite run out<br /> <br /> <br /> [P. 2]<br /> of the former, & was cadging off Newsome!<br /> The roads have dried up, & are really excellent<br /> top hole infact {sic}. I don’t suppose you would tolerate<br /> them one minute but to us they are perfect.<br /> <br /> Things have been moving along a bit since I<br /> last wrote to you, and by now you will have<br /> seen the results of last week’s fighting for La<br /> Bassée, & also Sunday night’s “scrap” as the<br /> papers call it round the village of St. Eloi.<br /> Both actions cost us pretty dearly I fancy. It<br /> seems that the worthy enemy were preparing for<br /> another of their marvellous marches on Calais when<br /> we took them on the hop, & collared a lot of<br /> ground, trenches, & a village, or two from them<br /> on the La Bassée front. On Sunday night<br /> they seem to have attempted to carry out their<br /> original intentions, & attacked the line to our left<br /> just out of our division. I happened to be<br /> with our “heavies” when the show started, and it<br /> looked pretty exciting I can tell you. The ground<br /> fairly shook & the reports of bursting shells merged<br /> <br /> <br /> [P. 3]<br /> into one continuous crash which was simply deafening.<br /> It startled us all a bit, for I for one, had never heard<br /> such a savage outburst of firing before, not even<br /> on the Aisne. We could see the ridge along<br /> which some of the shells were bursting, & it was<br /> just one sheet of vivid flame. However anyone<br /> could have the nerve to stick there even in a<br /> trench I don’t know. Soon the fire shifted further<br /> up the line to the real point of the intended<br /> attack, and they tossed over half a dozen big shells<br /> to put the wind up our heavy gunners who<br /> had become rather active, and I cleared out with<br /> my despatches for the column! It was getting late,<br /> & the light was failing, so the old girl & I pushed<br /> along. On arriving at the village I was surprised<br /> to see crowds of villagers standing in the road<br /> just clear of the houses, & on the neighbouring banks.<br /> Everyone it seemed had “properly got the wind up” old<br /> women were crying the younger ones looking anxious,<br /> and one, & all seized on one for news {sic}.<br /> <br /> By this time it was just dusk, and the firework<br /> effect of the battle now raging at its height was<br /> <br /> <br /> [P. 4]<br /> really very fine. The actual trench lines were<br /> hidden from our view by intervening hills, & woods<br /> but the heavy shells of the enemy could be seen<br /> distinctly bursting at various points as they searched<br /> the most likely places to find our heavy artillery.<br /> The whole scene was lighted by the weird bluish<br /> glare of their star shells which kept rising above<br /> the line of hills, & woods, and hanging for a<br /> moment only to plunge downwards once more, describing<br /> the most elegant curves of fire. At various points<br /> great vivid streaks would shoot upwards ever<br /> broadening until lost in the general reflection in<br /> the sky above denoting the burst of some enemy<br /> shell of heavy weight, and at frequent intervals<br /> one would see a lightning flash dart downwards<br /> amongst the trees showing the burst of a<br /> shrapnel. It was a queer sensation<br /> wondering how it was faring over there, and<br /> how big the casualty list would be in the papers<br /> that week. I was beginning to wonder where<br /> our good Commander in Chief would be, and what<br /> <br /> <br /> [P. 5]<br /> he would be doing. It was nearly four hours<br /> since the show started, & it had quietened<br /> down considerably. Suddenly in our rear far<br /> away in the distance a bright light twinkled,<br /> disappeared, and reappeared again a little closer.<br /> I remember drowsily thinking it might be the<br /> General’s car approaching when another came into<br /> view, and another until there must have been<br /> a hundred little twinkly lights all bobbing,<br /> and twisting about in a long snakey line one<br /> behind the other. Very soon a huge Daimler<br /> bus charged through the now deserted street<br /> quickly followed by others looking huge, & ominous<br /> in the darkness. “Reinforcements,” said someone.<br /> The next morning I was roused early by a renewed<br /> outburst on the same front which raged furiously<br /> for a few hours, and snuffed out. Later in<br /> the day one of the cyclists from the attacked<br /> division told me how we had lost in the night,<br /> and gained with interest in the early morning light.<br /> <br /> <br /> [P. 6]<br /> You can imagine all this, and heaps more happening<br /> every time that little announcement appears in<br /> the pages of The Times – “Enemy delivered a<br /> spirited attack with some success on our ——<br /> front. Our counter attack was completely<br /> successful leaving one of the enemy trenches<br /> in our hands.”<br /> <br /> Referring to Vin’s letter you might tell him<br /> I never mentioned badges to him. What I did<br /> ask for was copies of certain photos he has whose<br /> numbers I referred to. I also want a few copies<br /> of one I had taken of myself on a motor bike please.<br /> <br /> I am looking forward keenly to seeing Eddy<br /> out here again, & only hope we can manage to<br /> get him attached to the column again.<br /> <br /> You say your hospital is nearly empty I expect<br /> by now you will have received a fresh batch from<br /> the front. There will be a hell of a lot more<br /> too I am thinking before long. Eh bien au revoir.<br /> Don’t overwork yourself but keep fit they tell me<br /> medicine men are worth their weight in bank<br /> notes nowadays.<br /> <br /> Yours<br /> <br /> Bernard.","reject"

They were the culmination of a wave of persecution against gays in the still young Federal Republic of Germany - supported and pushed by lawyers who had already been active under during the Third Reich. The starting point of the trials was information provided by the 17-year-old hustler Otto Blankenstein. When he was arrested by the Frankfurt police in the summer of 1950, he tried to save himself by denouncing his customers. In the months that followed, more than 200 homosexual and bisexual men were investigated, and about 100 of them were arrested - men from all walks of life whose entire livelihood was thus destroyed. Six of those persecuted committed suicide. Blankenstein himself was charged and convicted despite his extensive collaboration with the lawyers.","accept"

Dries will see his girlfriend Greet, the owner of a small laundry. Manus hopes against hope that his girl Jans has been faithful to him. Toon's homecoming is dismal because his wealthy father rejects him on account of his dissolute life. During the absence of Dries, Greet has been courted unsuccessfully by Leendert, the pampered pet of his mother known as Auntie Piet, who runs the local pub. Piet browbeats her husband Gerrit, treats her poor relation Doortje as a drudge and idolizes her wastrel son. Determined that Leendert will marry Greet, Piet whispers in the ear of Betje that Greet is ""indecent"". However, when Betje tells her son Dries, he will not believe such gossip. In the pub one evening, when Leendert importunes Greet, Dries knocks him down. In the ensuing fight a knife is drawn. Policemen intervene and Dries is taken to gaol. Making use of the street-singers Na Druppel and De Mop, Piet spreads the rumour that Greet has been seen dancing with many men. When Dries is released, he asks Greet whether the story is true. She admits that she went to the dance-hall, but is given no chance to explain why. Disillusioned, Dries tells Manus and Toon that he intends to enlist as a colonial soldier. His comrades, equally unhappy in Amsterdam, Manus because of the way Jans treats him, Toon because he cannot find work, agree to join up at the same time. In a melancholy frame of mind the three mates leave for the Dutch East Indies, where they spend the following six years. When their term of service expires, the young men set off for Holland and home. Only two return, as Toon dies on the ship, a victim of his alcoholism and the tropical climate. Greet eagerly awaits the arrival of Dries. He has a surprise for her, namely the two half-blood children he has fathered. Greet has a similar surprise for him, namely that she is a widow and a mother. Nevertheless, their reunion is soon followed by an exuberant wedding.","accept"

For their adolescent daughter there is still some hope, as her main vice appears to be that she devours the novels of Emile Zola. The son leads a dissolute life in gambling dens, where he cheats at cards, and in night-clubs where he associates with disreputable characters and is having an affaire with a dancer. One evening the Count sees his drunk son thrown out of one of his usual haunts. At home in the castle, the son gives his father a revolver and begs the Count to shoot him because he knows that he is a rotter and is unable and unwilling to change his way of life. It is only when the son blames his degeneracy on his lineage that the Count, deeply insulted, pulls the trigger and shoots his son dead. During the trial that follows, the Count delivers a passionate speech in which he recalls how happy he and his wife were with the birth of a son but how alarmed they became when they were confronted with evidence of the boy's cruelty - as a boy he enjoyed killing and mutilating birds - and increasingly degenerate behaviour. He has killed his son, he says, to save the honour of his family. Nevertheless, for this murder he is sentenced to imprisonment. Five years later he is pardoned by the Kaiser. However, when he goes back home, his wife will have nothing to do with the man who murdered their son, even though a nun, Sister Thérèse, does her utmost to bring about a reconciliation. A man who kills his own son in order to keep the family ""pure"" is, in the eyes of the Countess, either a villain or a madman. Shortly thereafter, the physically and mentally broken Count De Gracé dies.","accept"

				 The Hague's 'holiday children's party' gave children from the city the opportunity to spend a day in nature, full of fresh air, fun, and a nutritious meal. Amersfoort, or rather the moors at Birkhoven and Soesterberg, was a popular destination. Because Amersfoort had a large garrison, soldiers were often used to help facilitate these events.
				 This reportage shows about a thousand children who gather at The Hague's Prinsengracht at six in the morning. The band is already there; two boys are heartily banging on their drums. Parents and other family members accompany the children to the train. Hanging out of the window, the children wave handkerchiefs to those who stay behind. At their destination, the Amersfoort Cavalry Corps await them with music. The children get a glass of milk, and army cooks prepare huge amounts of potatoes, beans, and 'gravy'. The film concludes with a lively parade, with a band leading the way.
				 One of the intertitles mentions that 'the children's friend Mr. Henry ter Hall' had also taken part in the day's events. This revue artist is not recognizable in the film, but he may be one of the men we see with glasses, moustache, and a hat in the front of the parade. Ter Hall, who at the time had political ambitions, often dedicated his efforts to The Hague's holiday children's party. He did not have any children from either of his two marriages.","reject"

They spend happy days together, until a fascinating gypsy girl visits the village and attracts Hendrik's attention. He soon tires of Annie, and his love for Aida ripens. Annie, heartbroken, becomes jealous of the gypsy and when she sees Hendrik and Aida enter a cafe together, her hate knows no bounds. In her home she finds a letter Hendrik has written to Aida asking her to meet him in the dunes.

Hendrik goes to return the guitar Aida had forgotten, but arrives before the girl. Tired out, he lies on the bed to await her return. He wakes to find the terrible reptile around him. Too late, the poisonous fangs have pierced his body, and when Aida returns she pulls the snake from him, but the viper coils itself around her and soon she has met the same death as Hendrik.

There is virtually no actuality material, all the points being explained by diagrams, models and workbench demonstrations. (Reel 1) ""Your friend the compass"", explains the cardinal and quadrantal points and the lubber line. The fact that a compass is a magnet is dealt with in some detail, and the principles of magnetism outlined (Reel 2) by means of bench demonstrations with iron filings and soft iron by an RAF tutor. (Reel 4 - there is no Reel 3) A magnet dips with the earth's magnetic field, and that magnetic variation is noted and dated on every chart. A Dip Circle is used to measure the angle of dip, which at London is 67 degrees. This dip affects the compass needle. The difference between the magnetic and true meridian is explained, along with the angle of variation between the two and the fact that the line of no variation is the Agonic Line. A map projection of the earth gives a double Agonic Line. The variation at London in 1920 is 14 degrees west, that of Paris 13 degrees west. The magnetic pole moves slightly so that ""about 1976"" the variation at London will be zero. The date and change in variation is used to correct the figure for magnetic north given on a chart. (Reel 5) The construction of the RAF Flat Type 253 Aero Compass is shown, compared to a standard ship's compass, and the evolution of the compass from the ancient type through to the present day. (Reel 6) More of the construction of the Type 253, followed by the construction of the RAF Upright Type 5/17 Aero Compass. The general principles of compass construction are described. A compass card (or needle) oscillates slightly in the manner of a pendulum swing. The Type 253 has an oscillation period of 25 seconds, the Type 5/17 an oscillation period of 12 seconds. The card should be allowed to oscillate gently in flight as attempts to correct each oscillation only produce a zig-zag flight course which increases, rather than decreases, the swing of the compass. (Reel 7) In a tight turn the aircraft floor tilts to be almost perpendicular to the ground, whereupon the compass acts as a Dip Needle and swings into the line of dip. Not until the aircraft has flattened out does the compass respond properly to the direction of the turn. On turning east or west from a southerly course the compass exaggerates the extent of the turn. On turning east or west from a northerly course the compass fails to show the turn until it is complete. The film ends abruptly at this point.","reject"

A one-legged soldier executes a jump - in fact three energetic hops ending in a controlled crouch. His finishing position is marked against that of previous contestants.

The bow is decorated with a central row of chevrons running vertically down the bow, in a similar fashion to many Lowbury stype brooches. There are two moulded ribs running across the width of the bow just above the catchplate. Lowbury brooches are identified with the Atrebates tribe of Hampshire and Berkshire and beyond.

The fragment weighs 3.67 grams.The find consists of an ovoid fragment of thick sheet metal projecting to a point at one end and with incised repoussé decoration; length, 32.5mm; width, 20mm. At the opposite end is a gable-shaped tab with a grooved, raised edge enclosing a wavy foliate motif and separated by a curved line of bead-and-reel (possibly the edge of a roundel or arcade) from a J-shaped scroll between frond-like elements and two amorphous bosses. Insufficient remains to identify the function of the piece with any certainty, although it is perhaps part of a decorative sheet covering for a book-cover, casket, or reliquary (cf. the late 8th/early 9th-century Enger Reliquary: P. Lasko, 1994 (2nd edn.), Ars Sacra 800-1200, Yale University Press, pls. 10-11).The foliate motif at the 'gable'  end resembles the stylised and occasionally very simplified acanthus borders found on ivory panels, metalwork and manuscripts of the Carolingian period in the 9th-10th centuries (e.g. above the canons of the gospel book Harley 2788), in which bead-and-reel frames also occur, as in the arcades of an ivory casket panel at Quedlinburg (O.M. Dalton, 1909, Catalogue of the Ivory Carvings of the Christian Era with examples of Mohammedan art and carvings in bone in the Department of British and Mediaeval Antiquities and Ethnography of the British Museum, London, 50, cat. no. 51, pl. 22, 51; J.

The terminals are 25 mm in length and 18.6 mm in width. The manilla is 180 mm in total length, 12.5 mm in width and 5 mm in thickness and has a diameter of 64.4 mm.   This arm-ring may have been worn, but it also may have been made from or used as a 'manilla'. Manillas were used as a form of money to trade for slaves on the West African coast from the time of Henry VIII right up until World War II. They are hard to date as they were made in the same way, using the same metals with the same decoration for a long time. The status of copper and its alloys in Africa was always high, so anything made of these metals would have had some value (Len Pole, pers comm).  Manillas of this type were mainly made for trade between Britain and West Africa in the 18th or 19th century, like examples in the Royal Institution of Cornwall's collections that came from Africa and were used as bracelets before being used as tokens for money. It could have come from the shipwreck of the 'Duoro' which was en route to Africa with other manillas on board when it was lost with all hands off Crebawethan, Western Rocks (to the southwest of the findspot), Isles of Scilly on 27th January, 1843.","accept"

Each has a brow decorated with longitudinal grooves, and the smaller head also has an undecorated brow beyond this which forms a T-shape with the nose. In the angles of the T are two rounded relief eyes, with cheeks curving around them. The larger head is similar, but with a triangular nose below which projects a flatter, longer triangle. From the edges of this project a pair of what are recognisable from a parallel (NLM947) as curving birds' necks, each with a groove around their inner edge. Most of the birds' heads are now missing, with different parts of the curled grooved beaks surviving, making each end apparently asymmetric.  The birds can also be read as forming a large moustache to the larger head.The reverse of the entire object is flat and undecorated, with two transverse lugs holding an iron pin bar. Length 19.85mm, width 18.55mm, thickness (including lugs) 7.74mm.Other knobs from florid cruciform brooches (e.g. DENO-84D5F3 , NMS-CDA2A2, , NMS-113DA2, NLM4515 and GLO-ABE2D2) also have geometric panels below the nose from which moustaches spring to end in birds' heads. All of these, however, have rectangular panels at one end, so attach to the headplate easily (compare the still-attached knob on NMS-6F9833).The closest parallel on the PAS database is NLM947, which has a simple projecting point instead of the smaller head, but a comparable pair of lugs on the reverse. These have probably developed from simpler prototypes such as the more complete brooch SF-4B6E83, but it is less clear how they were attached to the headplate.A similar object is listed in the 'Ancient & Oriental Ltd' Sales List 37, June 2002, p.14 no.241, listed as 'Small Anglo-Saxon scabbard mount incorporating human face with protruding tongue and two raven heads.

It is of ‘pointed oval’ type with a perforated lug on the reverse.  The legend reads in Lombardic lettering ‘+:S’[K]ATERIH:KNO?PT:’ and the design is of two joined petals.  The matrix measures 35mm long by 21mm wide by 9mm thick.  It has not been possible to locate a close parallel for this seal design.  It appears to be a variant of the limited range of fleur-de-lis or cross-like designs used on personal seals of this period.  The original owner of the seal was probably a woman named Katherine Knope.  Knope is a variant spelling of Knape, which is a surname derived from the Old English word cnapa meaning youth or servant.  As Knope or Knoppe it is found in Mount Bures parish including a Katherine Knope whose will was proved in 1548.  As Knape or Knapp it is recorded for Lawford, Dedham and Great Bentley in the sixteenth century (Emmerson, F. G. 1958. Wills at Chelmsford vol. 1 (1400-1619), page 247-248., and Reaney, P.H. 1958.

The brooch is incomplete having lost the upper section 'head' through a relatively recent break. Originally the brooch would have been broadly S-shaped with the upper terminal taking the form of a head with curved snout, and the lower (complete) terminal forming a tail. The pin, used to secure the brooch to a garment, is commonly looped around the upper neck. In this example it is secured by a sub-rectangular shaped catch plate which extends from the reverse face of the tail. This catchplate is formed from a vertical rib and the pin rest is turned over to form a U shape.   The brooch measures 45.8mm length, 27.6mm width is a maximum of 9mm thick (across the catch plate), and 3.7mm thick across the body / plate. It weighs 10.39 grams.   The front face of the brooch is decorated with a series of incised lines and panels of coloured enamel. The incised lines are curvi-linear in form mirroring the contours of the brooch and enamel panels. They are best described as tracery enclosing and forming delicate panels. The body of the brooch is decorated with three areas of enamel; the upper and lower panels are much decayed and were possibly poorly applied to the brooch as they have a considerable number of gas pockets / bubble present within the matrix. All the colour has been lost from these two areas, although it is possible that they were originally a red colour glassy enamel. The shape of these two upper and lower panels is best described as an irregular curvy triangle which mirrors the contours of the brooch. Between these two body panels is a sub-rectangular shaped panel of blue enamel. This is relatively well preserved and extends above the surface of the surrounding metal. The tail section of the brooch is also decorated with the delicately incised pattern. Here are two further enamel panels, one has again been lost, but was presumably red, the other a glassy yellow oval shape.   The reverse face of the brooch has also been decorated with incised designs. The body and foot of the brooch has been similar decorated with very fine incised curvi-linear lines mirroring the contours of the brooch, these are less fine than those present on the front face. The catchplate has also been decorated with a series of incised V shaped incised lines forming double vertical fibs on the body of the catchplate and reverse edge of the catch plate. These marks are not functional in nature.  The brooch has a bluey green coloured well developed patina which has been slightly abraded in places. The majority of abrasion is present on the edges of the brooch where some surface material has been lost. Here a light green powdery corrosion product is present, similar corrosion is present on the reverse face of the brooch. Bayley and Butcher identify the dragonesque style brooch as a development in British made plate brooches (p 171). They note that the distribution is mainly in Britain, with a marked concentration in the North, where they were presumably made (p172). Based on a review of published literature dating brooches Sally Worrell (unpublished, 2007) suggests that dragonesque style brooches date to the early phases of the Roman period in Britain c.

Wikipedia illustrates the arms of the de Valence Earls of Pembroke which are identical to those displayed on the pendant described above except for the fact that five bars are present, rather than four. Aylmer de Valence, brother of William, 1st Earl of Pembroke, was elected to the see of Winchester in 1250. The bishopric of Winchester owned the Manor of Swainston on the Isle of Wight. In 1255- 1256 Aylmer founded the new borough of Francheville alias Newtown within this manor (Beresford, M. 1959: 202-203).

The buckle is complete, comprising a frame, pin or tongue and plate (with an overall length of 97mm and a weight of 72.8g). The buckle frame is zoomorphic with two horse's heads facing each other and meeting at the centre (with a maximum thickness of 5.5mm). The ears of the horse protrude at the sides (producing a maximum width for the frame of 42.9mm). The snouts of the horses expand towards their ends and are separated by moulded grooves, defining a central rounded knop. The grooves accommodate the twin double-fork of the pin. The eyes of the horses are defined by cast spirals in relief. The spirals tail to form a rib along the necks of the horses, outside of which the frame is thinner (2.3mm compared to 4.2mm). At the base of the neck, at the attachment end of the buckle are three applied grooves, flanking a hinged loop at each side (with a depth of 8.7mm). The buckle frame has in-turned or involuted terminals. The rear of the frame is slightly convex with some finishing.The pin or tongue has a wide cast loop (10.2mm external diameter) and gradually widens and thickens before forming rearward projections (with a width of 22.7mm), which complement the in-turned terminals of the frame. The tongue has a double-forked pin. The pin and buckle frame are secured to the buckle pate with a circular-sectioned axis bar (2.8mm diameter), which is secured by closed loops in opposing directions at the terminal.The buckle plate (with an overall length of 66.2mm) has four hinge loops, which flank the two frame loops and the central tongue loop. The plate has openwork decoration within a rectangular frame (56.8mm long x 36.7mm wide and 3.6mm thick). The frame has an incised border with a rectangular panel on the frame side, containing diagonal grooves from alternating sides. At the centre of the frame is an openwork horse, trotting and facing towards the frame end. Grooves on the horse are used to define the snout, eyes, ears, mane and hoofs. Above the back of the horse is an pelta motif enhanced with grooved arcs. The pelta is thinner than the horse and it is unclear what, if anything it is intended to represent, possibly a tree or a much stylised rider. The rear end of the horse is poorly executed compared to the front. The reverse of the plate has four integral D-shaped lugs (8-9mm high and giving the plate a maximum depth of 12.8mm), positioned near each corner. Each lug has a central circular perforation (3.6mm - 3.9mm diameter) used to attach the buckle to the belt.The buckle has good surface preservation; a recently applied coating by the finder has produced a dark-green patina.Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the artefacts was carried out using a CamScanMaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX).The objects were examined whole within the specimen chamber and were analysed for 100 live seconds using a working distance of 35mm and an accelerating voltage of 20kV. Where possible, areas of metal exposed from under the surface corrosion were analysed. Apart from very superficial surface swabbing of the artefacts there was usually no further sample preparation. The results are semi-quantitative and overall totals taken from minimally prepared surfaces are usually affected to some degree by the surface geometry of the artefacts, including factors such as curvature, pitting and indentations etc. Other factors that can also affect the results include surface oxidation, surface enrichment or depletion of certain elements, contamination from closely adhering dirt, and preferential corrosion.Three separate readings were taken and the majority of the overall totals acquired were slightly low due to the factors described above. The results were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency between the readings and to make the analyses comparable with other results the average compositions were: 88-90% copper, 4% zinc and 5% tin. Minor amounts of lead, nickel and antimony also detectedThe buckle type is generally characteristic of a type of late Roman buckle, sometimes referred as the 'Soldiers and Settlers' type after an article by Chadwick, Dunning and Hawkes (1961)[1]. The buckle generally fits into their type II A (ibid. p 50-51), although it is slightly different in having a pair of facing horses on the frame, rather than the more usual dolphins, with horses generally appear on buckles of type I B, with projecting horse's heads facing away from each other. The tongue rarely survives on this buckle type but when it does, it commonly has the rear-facing projections but rarely has a double pin. The axis bar with terminal loops is also difficult to parallel and may have been replaced or is a repair. The elaborate openwork plate is also fairly difficult to closely parallel. The central horse figure is reminiscent of 'Horse-and-rider' type plate brooches of 2nd century date. The best identified parallel for the buckle plate is an example from Argeliers in southern France, published by Aurrecoechea Fernandez (1999)[2] as his 'Pseudo-Hispanic' 'Dolphin' Belts with Figural Decoration: 'Santome' type. As noted by the type name, the Argelier buckle has dolphins on the frame but has a similar plate with openwork horse and is without the pelta shape and also the rear attachment lugs. Pseudo-Hispanic buckles are characterised by shanks on the rear to attach the belt and examples with perforated lugs are difficult to identify. Aurrecoechea Fernandez (ibid) dates this type to between AD350 and 380 on the continent.[1] Chadwick, S., Hawkes & Dunning, G.C.; 1961; Soldiers and Settlers, fourth to fifth century: with a catalogue of animal-ornamented buckles and related belt-fittings; Medieval Archaeology; Journal of the Society of Medieval Archaeology, Vol. 5, p 1-70[2] Aurrecoechea Fernandez J.; 1999, Late Roman Belts in Hispania; Journal of Roman Military Equipment Studies Vol. 10, p 55-62","accept"

This composition was first printed in James Oswald's, 'The Curious Collection of Scots Tunes', in 1740. Despite the racy and risquǸ nature of the content, this song, when first published, was dedicated to the Duke of Perth. Whether this was a reflection of his reputation or not is still open to debate. The Dukedom of Perth was still a fairly new title in the 1740s although the Earldom of Perth had a long established history in the Drummond family. The Dukedom was, however, short-lived. The Drummonds were staunch Jacobites and so after 1745 the title was attainted and therefore remained dormant.","accept"

Burns left this very personal comment on this composition in his friend, Robert Riddell's copy of the 'Museum'. 'This song is the composition of a Jean Glover, a girl who was not only a whore, but also a thief; and in one or other character has visited most of the Correction Houses in the West. She was born, I believe, in Kilmarnock. I took down the song from her singing as she was strolling through the country, with a slight-of-hand blackguard.'

Burns enthusiastically collected songs from various sources, often expanding or revising them, whilst including much of his own work. The resulting combination of innovation and antiquarianism gives the work a feel of living tradition.
According to John Glen, in 'Early Scottish Melodies' (1900), 'This is a beautiful song written by Burns to a Highland melody contained in the Rev. Patrick McDonald's 'Collection of Highland Vocal Airs', etc., 1784.' He further enthuses that the 'tune is an excellent one'. A romantic story, surrounding the melody, tells of a piper playing 'The ancient Death-Song of the Skye-men' or 'Oran an Aoig' following the death of Cameron of Fassifern. This is highly unlikely as the tune cannot be played on the bagpipes.","accept"

After Burns's death in 1796 Johnson, the 'Museum's' editor, interpolated attributions to Burns as both a memorial and a money-spinner. As a result not all of the attributions are accurate and the fact is that the extent of Burns's involvement in the songs, as they are printed, can no longer be gauged. Although this piece is attributed to Burns, there are similarities between it and 'There's my thumb I'll ne'er beguile thee', especially to this song as it was printed in Ramsay's 'Tea-Table Miscellany' (1724-7).","accept"

There is very little known about the origins of this rather dubious song, with its strong anti-semitic sentiments. It tells the story of a Jewish girl or young woman enticing a young boy into her home and murdering him. It is probably best summed up as a product of its time when, as Glen (1900) puts it so eloquently, 'the population, through ignorance and superstition, encouraged and fed by the monks, believed in such tales, and without the least evidence made them a pretext for robbing and killing unfortunate and unoffending Jews, who were accused of murdering Christian children'. As to the tune, Glen was unable to find it in any collections printed prior to the the 'Museum'. He did, however, consider it to be 'of the mongrel species, compounded from 'The Mason's Anthem, Merrily dances the Quaker,' &c.'.","accept"

A set of masks was produced by Raul Ayala, a mask-maker and musician from Loiza, Puerto Rico. The tradition of mask-masking was passed down from his father Castor Ayala.

This mask is made from coconut shells. The face is carved to resemble exaggerated features and is always brightly painted and decorated with multiple long horns. It is worn by characters known as Vejigantes during the Festival of Saint James the Apostle on 25 July. 

The Festival is marked with a ten day celebration in Loiza, a town on the north-eastern coast of Puerto Rico. Loiza was one of the first colonial settlements on Puerto Rico and today has a large African population, descendants of slaves brought to Puerto Rico by the Spanish to work on sugarcane plantations.  The festivities to honour the saint are a blend of Spanish and African culture. Devotion is centred on three images of Saint James, represented as the patron of men, women and children. Each day, one of the images is taken from the home of its guardian and leads a procession to the church of Saint James in Loiza. The image is displayed for a day then a procession returns it to the guardian. These processions are repeated with each image. 
        
As part of the processions and the festivities in Loiza while the images are displayed, people dress up in costumes and dance to a style of music known as ‘bomba’. There are two traditional roles in the festival’s celebration. The first are the Vejigantes, or ‘little devils’. These characters represent the Muslims Saint James fought in the Reconquest of Spain. They wear multi-coloured overalls with wide sleeves resembling bat wings and the coconuts masks such as these. The other characters are Caballeros, who portray Spanish knights. They wear aristocratic dress of a jacket, trousers, and a cape, in bright red, yellow and green fabrics. Their masks are made of wire mesh, moulded to simulate a Spaniard’s face.

Spearthrowers, often generally termed woomera when they are from Australia, enabled the Aboriginal hunter or warrior to propel his spear with greater force and accuracy over greater distances. They were immensely useful tools, and were found throughout the continental mainland of Australia in a vast array of different forms. 

This leaf-shaped style was manufactured throughout Western Australia, and bears the characteristic linear grooves of that region’s decorative arts on its upper, concave side. The short wooden peg that fits into the spear-butt is secured by a blob of Spinifex gum (Triodia spp.), and the handle is formed at the other end from the same material. This object has additional interest in also demonstrating the widespread Aboriginal practice of combining two tools in one:

The art of cricket fighting as a sport, began in the early Song dynasty (960-1127). The rule being ""eighth month buy, ninth month raise, tenth month contest"". The association with courage is directly related to gambling on the fighting crickets.

Ās replaced ganjafa, which was the card game associated with the Safavid dynasty. 

Cards used for playing ās are distinguished from each other by five ground colours. They are ranked as follows starting with the highest: black: Ās (the Ace); green: Šāh (the Shah); yellow: Bibi (the Queen); golden yellow: Sarbāz (the Jack); and red: Lakkāt (the Harlot, the lowest in value).

The faces of the Horniman cards (nn16137) are decorated in a style typical for ās cards: images are framed by medallions with foliate decoration in the corners. The ās is represented by a lion and the human-faced sun (Ḵoršid-ḵānom) , a motif chosen by the Qajar Dynasty as their badge. The šāh is shown in a European-style officer’s uniform. The bibi is shown admiring a flower. The sarbāz is represented by a soldier with a musket in a European-style uniform with frogging and a tufted(?) cap bage.  The lowest suit, the lakkāt, is represented by a woman drinking from a wine glass.

The use of European uniforms for the shah and the sarbāz’s costumes reflects increasing European influence over the organisation, training and equipment of Iran’s military during the nineteenth century. 

The Encyclopaedia Iranica tells us that:
“The rules [of ās] are similar to those of American poker but there is no flush, straight flush, colour and straight. Moreover it is not possible to exchange cards because a pack is composed of 25 cards only, with five suits. Normally five persons play, each one receiving five cards. The highest hand is panj-sar, which means a player has five cards of one suit. Should more than one player who placed his stakes have a suit, the one whose suit has the higher value wins the game, i.e. the suit of ās precedes that of Shahs etc. The next highest hand is čāhār-sar, which means holding four cards of one suit. It is followed by se-opas, i.e. three cards of one suit and two of another. This is followed by se-sar, i.e. three cards of a suit and two cards of different suits. Then do-pas follows for which the player needs two cards of two suits each. The lowest hand is do-sar, i.e. two cards of one suit. Bluffing is a main feature of this game.” (Roschanzamir, M, 2011). Set of 25 playing cards for tha game of ās, one missing, mounted on thick card with a string at the top for suspension. The cards depict five suits of courtly portraits: 1. Male figure in a plumed hat (the shah or king); 2. Female figure wearing a crown (the bibi or queen); 3. Male figure holding a weapon (the sarbāz or jack); 4. Lion and human-faced sun (Ḵoršid-ḵānom) (the ās or ace) ; 5. Female figure holding flowers (the lakkāt or harlot). The cards are printed on paper and lacquered with cloth backing on card. They are in the Qajar style.","accept"

In most coastal areas of Oceania, both men and women have traditionally occupied themselves in the business of getting protein from the sea, although usually the sexes take on different kinds of work. This ‘gendered division of labour’ (as anthropologists call it) requires different tools for taking different kinds of prey.

This net of coarse rope on a wooden frame is from the southern coast of Central Province in Papua New Guinea. It is a woman’s fishing net for use in the hand, and reflects the general rule of women fishing on foot and inshore (inside and on top of the fringing reef of coral), while men tend to fish from boats outside the reef in deeper waters. Working together to guide the fish into their nets, groups of related women will often equal or exceed the catches of their men-folk. 

It often seems that the large, deep-sea fish that men catch are given greater cultural importance in societies where both of the sexes fish, and it is worth asking if there is a sexist bias in the way these different kinds of work are valued. Anthropologists working in this region of the Western Pacific have shown that the kind of coastal fishing that women do is much more likely to succeed at all than the deep-sea fishing of men, and that it occupies much less of the women’s time. However, the same studies have found that the times when men make successful catches at sea, the amount of meat they obtain is larger and, as a result of that, men more often share their catch with distant relatives, or trade a surplus of fish with other people for exotic goods. Both kinds of fishing are good, therefore, and complement each other very well.

Wood, vegetable fibre. Early 20th Century. Collected in 1904 by the Cooke-Daniels Ethnographical Expedition, and presented to the Horniman Museum in 1906 by Dr. C. G. Seligman. Woman's hand net made from a U-shaped piece of wood with a vegetable fibre net bound over the wood.","accept"

It was made by members of the Dakota tribe, also known as the Santee Sioux. The Dakota people’s homelands are in the northern Plains states Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska.
 
The shirt is made from buckskin and decorated with a fringe, bands of beadwork on the shoulders and back, and locks of human hair. Before contact with white settlers, Plains tribes made their clothing from the hides of deer or buffalo, the main food source of Plains Indians. Beadwork decoration increased with trade between the Native American tribes and Europeans. Beadwork replaced or was used alongside quillwork, a form of embroidery using the quills of porcupines. The designs and colours used on clothing all have symbolic meanings relating to warfare, the landscape or human virtues. The patterns are made of different elements representing objects. The beadwork over the shoulders contains the leaf and feather patterns. Locks of hair on shirts either represented scalps taken in battle or were offerings from relatives to honour the warrior. These shirts were worn as a badge of honour by the bravest warriors in Plains society. 

By the time Eric Horniman visited America, the traditional way of life of the Dakota was disappearing. The Sioux tribes fought a series of battles known as the Sioux Wars between 1862 until 1890, attempting to stop white settlements in their territory, and were eventually moved onto reservations. Although Plains Indians continued to make war shirts to honour their beliefs, collectors bought their work believing their culture was disappearing, as part of what is known as ‘salvage ethnography’. Plains Indians continue to make shirts today as regalia for ceremonies or to celebrate accomplishments. It is unclear how authentic this shirt may be, since objects were created specifically for the tourist market by reservation Indians. Buckskin shirt with integral fringing around the hem and cuffs. It is decorated with panels of polychrome beadwork and attached locks of hair.","accept"

Literally a ‘dead head’, ulumate wigs from Fiji were worn by men for a number of different reasons. For most men, they were worn as simple vanities, either to replace what aging had taken, or to cover a shaven head while the hair grew back in. Fijians generally shaved their heads when they were in mourning for a close relative, and this was a great sacrifice. Like most other Polynesian and Melanesian men, the Fijians were traditionally very conscious of their personal appearance, and spent a lot of time dyeing and trimming their hair and beards. Sometimes, a person might shave their head to ease a problem with lice, but there were generally herbal medicines for such things.

For some men, however, the ulumate was a badge of office: an early anthropologist of Fiji, A.M. Hocart tells us how some men were appointed to the title of qita, and had the exclusive right to harvest the delicious but scarce wi fruit (Eugenia brasiliensis) for each village. The qita was entitled to spear anyone who stood in his path while he brought the wi fruit to the village temple (bure), or who sought to interfere with his equal sharing out of the fruit. The ulumate wig was only one part of a complex costume that the qita put on to fulfil his role.

In earlier times, ulumate were always made from human hair – either that of victims taken and killed in war, of women, or of slaves. This was tied, lock by lock, into a finely made net of coconut fibre. The wig was stored inside-out to maintain its body. Following the introduction of the horse into Fiji as a draft animal for the sugar plantations, many ulumate were made from horse-hair.

Human hair, coconut fibre. Mid 19th Century. Formerly in the private collection of James Edge Partington. Wig of dyed human hair, the locks are tied into a coir hairnet. These wigs were used to conceal baldness, which might be natural, or result from ceremonial shaving of the head during mourning observances.","accept"

Clay figures of women lying on beds have been found in domestic, temple and grave sites. They may have been used to ensure fertility or have been used for healing and then ritually broken after use. Until recently these figures tended to be called 'concubine figures' with their purpose being to provide a sexual partner for the dead man (e.g. Petrie 1927, 9) However, as Pinch (1983) has pointed out such figures occur in female burials, in temples and in houses. Some have suggested that the figure represents a mother goddess. However, Egyptian goddesses are rarely shown nude. The figurines have also been interpreted as dancing girls. Several seem to have been votive offerings to Hathor. Hathor is associated with fertility and the nude nature of the figurines, together with the heavy wigs depicted on a number of them, and the fact that they are shown on beds may also suggest fertility. However, evidence from text suggests that figures like this were used in healing rites. The Egypt Centre has a separate Information Sheet on this item.","accept"

This car has a vertical twin engine with automatic inlet valves, a three speed gear box and a shaft drive, and bears the makers' plate on the engine. According to Mr. Tom Slater, the founder of the present firm of motor body builders, Simpson & Slater, of Alfreton Road, the Celer Motor Car Company was an offshoot of the Leader Company, a Berkshire bicycle manufacturing concern, and their premises at Bobbers Mill were a stone's throw from his own workshops. They made only three of these cars, as prototypes, but never developed a full production run."" (Report of the Director of Leisure Services 2/1/1975) ""The car was found in 1965 in a barn in Exeter by Mr. O.G. Gray, the present owner, who was told by the farmer that it had not been used for 40 years, though local people remembered it being driven by a Mr. Brock, of Exeter, in the years before the first world war. Mr Gray restored the car to mint condition, doing all the work himself, and it completed its first London to Brighton run in November 1967. He re-registered the car with its original Nottingham number AU 250. The car has been featured in the Nottingham Evening Post and the Daily Telegraph in 1967, and is the subject of a small article in 'The Complete Encyclopaedia of the Motor Car, 1885-1968' by G. N.

You have no idea what<br /> rottenly made stuff they use out here it is<br /> mostly lead I think, & the knives never cut.<br /> Half the village has been in to inspect I am<br /> told, but luckily I’ve been out!<br /> <br /> <br /> The cake is quite the best Mary has sent out,<br /> & has lasted two tea parties, (fights, or actions,<br /> comme vous voulez!) already, and looks good for another<br /> attack! The knee pads are a great boon, &<br /> have arrived in time to prevent my legs chafing<br /> the corners of the tank quite away. The jets & {unreadable}<br /> have been put to excellent use already, & should<br /> prove invaluable. Thanks so much also for the<br /> gaspers & chocolate biscuits. I had quite run out<br /> <br /> <br /> [P. 2]<br /> of the former, & was cadging off Newsome!<br /> The roads have dried up, & are really excellent<br /> top hole infact {sic}. I don’t suppose you would tolerate<br /> them one minute but to us they are perfect.<br /> <br /> Things have been moving along a bit since I<br /> last wrote to you, and by now you will have<br /> seen the results of last week’s fighting for La<br /> Bassée, & also Sunday night’s “scrap” as the<br /> papers call it round the village of St. Eloi.<br /> Both actions cost us pretty dearly I fancy. It<br /> seems that the worthy enemy were preparing for<br /> another of their marvellous marches on Calais when<br /> we took them on the hop, & collared a lot of<br /> ground, trenches, & a village, or two from them<br /> on the La Bassée front. On Sunday night<br /> they seem to have attempted to carry out their<br /> original intentions, & attacked the line to our left<br /> just out of our division. I happened to be<br /> with our “heavies” when the show started, and it<br /> looked pretty exciting I can tell you. The ground<br /> fairly shook & the reports of bursting shells merged<br /> <br /> <br /> [P. 3]<br /> into one continuous crash which was simply deafening.<br /> It startled us all a bit, for I for one, had never heard<br /> such a savage outburst of firing before, not even<br /> on the Aisne. We could see the ridge along<br /> which some of the shells were bursting, & it was<br /> just one sheet of vivid flame. However anyone<br /> could have the nerve to stick there even in a<br /> trench I don’t know. Soon the fire shifted further<br /> up the line to the real point of the intended<br /> attack, and they tossed over half a dozen big shells<br /> to put the wind up our heavy gunners who<br /> had become rather active, and I cleared out with<br /> my despatches for the column! It was getting late,<br /> & the light was failing, so the old girl & I pushed<br /> along. On arriving at the village I was surprised<br /> to see crowds of villagers standing in the road<br /> just clear of the houses, & on the neighbouring banks.<br /> Everyone it seemed had “properly got the wind up” old<br /> women were crying the younger ones looking anxious,<br /> and one, & all seized on one for news {sic}.<br /> <br /> By this time it was just dusk, and the firework<br /> effect of the battle now raging at its height was<br /> <br /> <br /> [P. 4]<br /> really very fine. The actual trench lines were<br /> hidden from our view by intervening hills, & woods<br /> but the heavy shells of the enemy could be seen<br /> distinctly bursting at various points as they searched<br /> the most likely places to find our heavy artillery.<br /> The whole scene was lighted by the weird bluish<br /> glare of their star shells which kept rising above<br /> the line of hills, & woods, and hanging for a<br /> moment only to plunge downwards once more, describing<br /> the most elegant curves of fire. At various points<br /> great vivid streaks would shoot upwards ever<br /> broadening until lost in the general reflection in<br /> the sky above denoting the burst of some enemy<br /> shell of heavy weight, and at frequent intervals<br /> one would see a lightning flash dart downwards<br /> amongst the trees showing the burst of a<br /> shrapnel. It was a queer sensation<br /> wondering how it was faring over there, and<br /> how big the casualty list would be in the papers<br /> that week. I was beginning to wonder where<br /> our good Commander in Chief would be, and what<br /> <br /> <br /> [P. 5]<br /> he would be doing. It was nearly four hours<br /> since the show started, & it had quietened<br /> down considerably. Suddenly in our rear far<br /> away in the distance a bright light twinkled,<br /> disappeared, and reappeared again a little closer.<br /> I remember drowsily thinking it might be the<br /> General’s car approaching when another came into<br /> view, and another until there must have been<br /> a hundred little twinkly lights all bobbing,<br /> and twisting about in a long snakey line one<br /> behind the other. Very soon a huge Daimler<br /> bus charged through the now deserted street<br /> quickly followed by others looking huge, & ominous<br /> in the darkness. “Reinforcements,” said someone.<br /> The next morning I was roused early by a renewed<br /> outburst on the same front which raged furiously<br /> for a few hours, and snuffed out. Later in<br /> the day one of the cyclists from the attacked<br /> division told me how we had lost in the night,<br /> and gained with interest in the early morning light.<br /> <br /> <br /> [P. 6]<br /> You can imagine all this, and heaps more happening<br /> every time that little announcement appears in<br /> the pages of The Times – “Enemy delivered a<br /> spirited attack with some success on our ——<br /> front. Our counter attack was completely<br /> successful leaving one of the enemy trenches<br /> in our hands.”<br /> <br /> Referring to Vin’s letter you might tell him<br /> I never mentioned badges to him. What I did<br /> ask for was copies of certain photos he has whose<br /> numbers I referred to. I also want a few copies<br /> of one I had taken of myself on a motor bike please.<br /> <br /> I am looking forward keenly to seeing Eddy<br /> out here again, & only hope we can manage to<br /> get him attached to the column again.<br /> <br /> You say your hospital is nearly empty I expect<br /> by now you will have received a fresh batch from<br /> the front. There will be a hell of a lot more<br /> too I am thinking before long. Eh bien au revoir.<br /> Don’t overwork yourself but keep fit they tell me<br /> medicine men are worth their weight in bank<br /> notes nowadays.<br /> <br /> Yours<br /> <br /> Bernard.","reject"

The current survey has revealed 18 projects, of which 12 are full research projects, four are Cultural Resource Management (CRM) projects and two are aimed at developing field methods. Minor projects based on the work of individuals prevail among the research projects, although at least one large-scale project is reported. Three of the four CRM projects are “flagships” for their country (Denmark, Norway and Sweden). The paper takes a critical attitude towards the current development in Scandinavian Archaeology, where an obvious disparity between administrative and research archaeology prevails. The way GIS is applied may be seen as a good example of what this disparity means. Large scale uses of GIS occur in the CRM context, but primarily not with a research aim. Ambitious research projects, on the other hand, are promoted by research institutions, but generally they appear impotent due to a lack of resources. Further, the paper focuses on demands for making GIS a success in archaeological research. Issues discussed here are: active research contributions from CRM units in the future; better access to digital map information for non-profit research projects; education, education and once more education of archaeologists.","reject"
