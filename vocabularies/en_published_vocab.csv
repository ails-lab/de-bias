According to 18th and 19th century racial sciences, humans were divided into groups, arranged hierarchically. These typologies reinforced colonial ideologies of difference. While race is not a biological fact, it has social consequences. Racism, therefore, should be understood as a form of prejudice and discrimination based on the presumed superiority of one group over another.","There is no easy alternative for this term. The term is used by some in quotation marks to acknowledge the controversy surrounding the term. Racism is a valid term to use, as it acknowledges the discriminatory practices of racial thinking.","Andrei Nesterov, Laura Hollink, Marieke van Erp, and Jacco van Ossenbruggen.
